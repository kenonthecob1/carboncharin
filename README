This is a very rough project to play with python for the 24 hour hackron hackathon.
Inspired by how we were both in organic chemistry at the time and drawing line structures and naming them is very tedious.
Supports carbon based line strucutres with halogen attachments and will give proper name, but formatted a little ugly.
Uses turtle graphics.
